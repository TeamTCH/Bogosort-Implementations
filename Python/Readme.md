# This is a simple python console implementation of BogoSort.
*The purpose of this was to quickly brush up on basic syntax that Python uses
*This project was put together in PyCharm, as it's my preferred Python IDE

*Honestly this was probably the easiest implementation of Bogosort that I've done so far, since it was only two methods and wasn't required to output any information to, or even work with any sort of user interface, and that's the part that normally takes up significant chunks of time.
