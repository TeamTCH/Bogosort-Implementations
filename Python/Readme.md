#This is a simple python console application built with PyCharm Community
#that implements the BogoSort algorithm.
#The purpose of this was to quickly brush up on basic syntax that Python uses.

#Honestly this was probably the easiest implementation of Bogosort
#that I've done so far, since it was only two methods and wasn't
#required to output any information to, or even work with any
#sort of user interface, and that's the part that normally takes up
#significant chunks of time.
